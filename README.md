# frontend-guild-code-challenges
The official GitHub repo for the code challenges from the frontend slack channel

**The Rules in general for the coding challenges:**
- HTML and CSS only: (may be preprocessed like SASS and PUG)
- Text such as letters and numbers may come from the HTML. Everything else is created by pure styling and nested (empty) HTML elements. (Do not load an image or use other assets)
- Only use your own code, you created or at least understand

> **ChatGPT** > nah
> **External Libraries** > nah
> **Stackoverflow** -> Yeah
